# Role Playing Game 🎮🧙‍♂️
 A text-based role playing game based on [projektuppgift](https://github.com/onni82/projektuppgift).
 The original project was a school assignment while taking Programming 1 at a municipal school.

# Plans 📝
 * Translate all the original comments from Swedish to English.
 * Store item descriptions and item effects in an SQLite database or as an array, instead of writing loads of if-statements. Will have to update void UseItem() and string GetItemDescription().
 * Save feature.
 * Store separate game stories that can be loaded as files? A BIG MAYBE.
