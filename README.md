# Role Playing Game 🎮🧙‍♂️
 A text-based role playing game based on [projektuppgift](https://github.com/onni82/projektuppgift).
 The original project was a school assignment while taking Programming 1 at a municipal school.

# Plans 📝
 * Store item descriptions in an SQLite database or as an array, instead of writing loads of if-statements.
 * Save feature.
 * Store separate game stories that can be loaded as files? A BIG MAYBE.
