# 1. Role Playing Game 🎮🧙‍♂️
 A text-based role playing game based on [projektuppgift](https://github.com/onni82/projektuppgift).
 The original project was a school assignment while taking Programming 1 at a municipal school.

# 2. Plans 📝
 2.1 To be worked on
 * Store item descriptions and item effects in an SQLite database or as an array, instead of writing loads of if-statements. Will have to update void UseItem() and string GetItemDescription().
 * Add function that checks the player's and monster's health that can be called whenever during battle, so there won't be copy-pasted code everywhere.
 * Save feature.
 * Store separate game stories that can be loaded as files? A BIG MAYBE.

 2.2 Is currently working on
 * Something will show up here soon.

 2.3 Have worked on
 * Translated all the original comments from Swedish to English.
